# Dynamic-HTTP-Server
Content served dynamically from array of products in JSON file, and the HTML generated on the server side using handlebars npm package.
There are many ways of generating HTML to send to clients: concatenating strings, search and replace, template strings, and even a library such as cheerio could
be used. Templating is, in general, the easiest since you can store the template in a separate file that can be written just like a normal HTML file but with some
placeholders. Here, we used handlebars templating library to do it.
